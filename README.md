# Obesity Dataset Analysis

This project analyzes the **Obesity Dataset (ObesityData.csv)** by *Palechor & de la Hoz Manotas (2019)* to estimate obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition among individuals from **Colombia, Peru, and Mexico**.  

## üìä Dataset Description
The dataset includes demographic, lifestyle, and health-related variables:
- **Categorical variables**: Gender, Family history with overweight, FAVC, CAEC, SCC, CALC, MTRANS, etc.
- **Numerical variables**: Age, Height, Weight, FCVC, NCP, CH2O, FAF, TUE, etc.

## üìù Lab Tasks
1. Import and explore the dataset in R.
2. Frequency tables and percentage distribution of categorical variables.
3. Graphical presentation (bar charts, pie charts, etc.).
4. Summary statistics of numerical variables (mean, median, mode, variance, IQR, etc.).
5. Graphical presentation of numerical variables (histograms, boxplots, stem-leaf, etc.).
6. Normality test ‚Üí choose appropriate descriptive measures & graphs.
7. Subgroup analysis of numerical variables by categorical groups.
8. Scatterplots & regression lines; scatterplot matrix.
9. Data recoding and factor labeling.
10. Calculate BMI and categorize into Underweight/Normal/Overweight/Obesity.
11. Conditional BMI calculations for subgroups.
12. Create sub-dataset & calculate summary measures.
13. Correlation analysis between numerical variables.
14. Correlation matrix & hypothesis testing.
15. One-sample tests (t-test/z-test, parametric vs. non-parametric).
16. Two-sample/group comparison tests.
17. ANOVA/Non-parametric tests for multi-group comparisons.
18. Chi-square/Fisher‚Äôs exact test for association between BMI and categorical variables.
19. Build multiple regression models.
20. Model building, selection, assumptions checking, residuals analysis, outlier detection.
21. Random sample analysis & comparison with full dataset.
